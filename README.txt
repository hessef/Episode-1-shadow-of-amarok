Firstly, thank you for trying out my game! There are a few things that you need to know to play, and here they are:

This game works best when full-screened. please remember that.



Whenever the game requires confirmation to continue (it will not do anything for several seconds), press the ENTER key. This is told to you in the game,
but I figured I should probably put it here as well. Additionally, whenever there are multiple choices, each choice will correspond to a number, so hit
that number and the ENTER key to select an option. Finally, for whatever reason Norton Anti-Virus software, along with other anti-virus software can
sometimes interfere with the game for some reason. If you encounter this issue, just turn off the software while you are playing.
(It's a short game, so it should be fine.) Also, this game plays in the terminal app, and I reccomend that you fullscreen it. Additionally, this game
does NOT have a save system. So if you quit midway through, you will lose all your progress.
Oh, and if it won't work in terminal like it's supposed to, download Python 3.6 from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install it, then run the .py version of the game with IDLE. thanks!

Again, thank you SO much for playing, and I hope you have fun!
